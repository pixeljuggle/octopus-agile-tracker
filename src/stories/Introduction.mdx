# Vite Boilerplate Design System

When you work with large projects, it's important that you remain consistent throughout the codebase and follow the best practices. To guarantee the quality of your codebase, you need to analyze different levels of the applications code.

### Make it consistent for everyone and anyone

The Design System provided should give anyone the opportunity to use or anticipate the use of the system by providing the right amount of information (documentation, design, code, ...)

### Data informs design

Data is our side kick, we are data informed but not data-driven all the time.

### Make the default settings smart

Every new feature we do should be easy to understand by default. The default setting should be adaptative, easy-to-use, smart, and efficient for any usecase. And offering plenty of ways to customise any feature.

### TypeScript Style Guide

[Google TypeScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html) is based on the internal Google TypeScript style guide. All examples given are non-normative and serve only to illustrate the normative language of the style guide.

### Clean Code

This is the most abstract level of code standardization. It's related to the implementations independent of the programming language. It will help the readability of your code.
